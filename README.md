# Logo Generator

## Description
This logo generator asks the user for text, a shape, and colors, and creates a simple SVG logo
based on them.  I created this app as an exercise in Object-Oriented Programming, and in testing
with Jest.

[View sample output](./logo.svg)

## Usage
The program can be launched with either `node index.js` or `npm start`.  The color prompts accept
[CSS color values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value).  The shape's color
can either fill the shape, or be used as an outline.

## Credits
The logo generator app uses the [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) package
for user input, and [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest/v/29.5.0) for testing.
